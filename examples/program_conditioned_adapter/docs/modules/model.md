## model.py — Snapshot Helpers (Reserved)

Placeholder for snapshot utilities. In this codebase, snapshot resolution is handled by `model.hf_snapshot.ensure_snapshot` and local builders; this module remains minimal.

### Note
If you need to customize snapshot discovery logic, wire it through runner/build scripts rather than expanding this module.
